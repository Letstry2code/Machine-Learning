When we have Data 

>>> Data
    >>> Tabular format
  # 1      >>> Dependent Variable       (Known end result,parameter)  Supervised ML Problems
           >>> Independent Variable 





DV > Target/Outcome       (Y)      Single Column Data
IV > Features Values      (X)      May be more than 1 column of Data




  # 2 If there is no DV  >>>>> Unsupervised ML Problems





  # Real Time Generated DataSet >>> reinforcement


  Ex :
    House Price Prediction >>> Supervised ML
    Classify Birds Species >>> Supervised ML
    Group a set of customers in a shop  >>> Unsupervised ML   as the data doesnt have any prior defination
    Find Similar types of News >>> Unsupervised ML
    Self Driving Car >>> reinforcement
    Game Enemy AI >>> reinforcement

        Classification Problem

    > Ensemble ML For Regression (Hybrid)





Prediction For Single Variable is done by Calculating mean 

Base Model



Residual Errors of Best Fit Line


            Square Sum of Errors  <<< SSE >>>




Simple Linear Regression 

y= mx + C

y= B0 + B1x + e


y(hat) = B0 + B1x


B0 == Intercept of Y
B1 == Slope



SSR = SSE - SST


SSR/SST = Coefficient of R^2    (R^2)=== Accuracy
